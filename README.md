# pneumonia-covid-detection
Project on detecting Covid/Pneumonia using Xray Images

Each year, pneumonia affects about 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths. A chest X-ray is often used to diagnose pneumonia. 
We propose a Deep Learning model trained on X ray images which will aid the doctors in the diagnosis.
