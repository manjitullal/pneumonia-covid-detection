# pneumonia-covid-detection
Project on detecting Covid/Pneumonia using Xray Images

Each year, pneumonia affects about 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths. A chest X-ray is often used to diagnose pneumonia. 
We propose a Deep Learning model trained on X ray images which will aid the doctors in the diagnosis.

Dataset 

The main dataset we would like to use for this project is the CovidX dataset, which combines multiple open source Covid datasets.

We also plan on using a second, larger dataset: MIMIC-CXR or NIH Chest X-Ray
